# Joker

**This software is not developed anymore**

Joker is a chess engine written at the end of '90s to study AI techniques
for game programming (probably it contains one of the first implementation of the [MTD-f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTD-f) search algorithm).

It's offered without support, as "historical" artifact, under the terms
of the MIT license.
